# Installation

*The Game of Life* is currently early in development, not even ready
for Alpha stage, so to install it you'll have to install the Rust
compiler and build system.

## 0.0 Downloading

Go to the button that says "Clone or Download" on
your
[GitHub page](https://github.com/christopherdumas/The-Game-of-Life),
click it, choose to download a ZIP, open that ZIP.

## 1.0 Rust Installation

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a safe, advanced, low-level systems
programming language, aimed right at C++.
To install it, open a Terminal and run:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

## 2.0 Running the Game

Once your installation has completed, navigate to the unzipped folder
of the game, and run `cargo run`. It should take a bit the first time
to install packages. This shouldn't happen again.
