# Skyspace
## A Survival City Building Roguelike

In *Skyspace* you are the first few settlers on a hostile
planet in a far-removed star system. You are all alone, but if you
succed in showing your homeworld that this new frontier is habitable
and profitable, more settlers will join you.

*Skyspace* is a strategically deep, complex (but not
complicated), permissive world. It wants to be your sandbox: there are
as few restrictions as possible on what you can do. You start with
only a few tools in your toolbox and through your own prowess, smarts
and enginuity you can expand your abilities. There's no limit to how
far you can go!

In *Skyspace* you start out with a single character. This
represents your first settler. You designate jobs and your settler
will proceed to do them. You goal for the first part of the game is to
survive. If you keep your settler alive long enough, others will start
coming to help you. Each character has their own special talents, but
they can learn new ones as you assign jobs. You can tell each
character what jobs they're allowed to do, and which they are not. By
default, they'll be allowed to do some basic things to keep themselves
alive and help others, as well as their beginning talents. As they
gain skill in certain areas, they'll start being able to expand to
similar areas, as well as completing the jobs they're talented at
faster.

In *Skyspace* your entire environment is interacive. You can
cut down trees, gather plants, delve into mountains, re-channel
rivers, dig holes, harness the flow of magma from underground and
build any number of things. Plants have different medicinal properties
and stones have different values and strengths. Woods have different
values, strengths, and weights, and water can be varying levels of
dirty.

Rope, levers, pressure plates, mills, wheels, drawbridges,
waterwheels, corkscrews, tracks, steam and plenty of other mechanical
elements will be added eventually to allow for even more fun.

As the seasons come and go, you must provide food, shelter,
occupation, and creature comforts for your characters, or they might
die or go insane. You must also defend not only against the elements
but also against beasts and malevolent aliens.
